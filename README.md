## Technical Overview
A portfolio site is essential for every software developer to showcase projects and technical skills which demonstrates what you can do based upon your resume. 

So I have built my site using react.js as a front end, node.js as a back-end, and MongoDB as storage, for better performance I have implemented server-side rendering technique which is a very popular technique for rendering client-side webpage on the server and server will send the complete result to the client, and to bundle the module I have used Webpack which is a module bundler to bundle javascript, front-end assets.
